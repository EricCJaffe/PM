# BusinessOS — PM (Project Management Module)

## Build & Development Commands
- `npm run dev` — local dev server (Next.js)
- `npm run build` — production build
- `npm run lint` — ESLint
- `npm run seed` — seed project templates to Supabase (`npx tsx supabase/seeds/seed.ts`)
- TypeScript scripts: `npx tsx scripts/<name>.ts`

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 15+ (App Router) + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS (dark theme — bg: `#0f172a`, card: `#1e293b`, text: `#e2e8f0`)
- Supabase (auth, Postgres + RLS, Storage for vault files)
- `@supabase/ssr` for server/client session management
- OpenAI SDK (`gpt-4o`) for AI chat, report generation, project analysis
- `gray-matter` for YAML frontmatter parsing in markdown vault files
- Vercel for deployment (auto-deploys on push to `main`)
- GitHub: `EricCJaffe/PM`

## Architecture — Dual-Layer Storage
Every project object lives in two places simultaneously:
1. **Supabase DB** — structured columns for fast queries, dashboards, and AI reasoning
2. **Supabase Storage** — `.md` files with YAML frontmatter at `vault/[org-slug]/[project-slug]/...`

Writes go to DB first, then generate/update the `.md` file. Reads use DB for structured queries, Storage files for full content display and export.

## Doc Maintenance Rules
When making changes, update the relevant docs **in the same commit**:

| Change type | Update |
|---|---|
| Major architectural decision | New ADR in `docs/DECISIONS/NNNN-<slug>.md` |
| New or changed feature | `docs/TASKS.md` (mark done or add new) |
| New integration or service | `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md` |
| New env var or secret | `docs/ENVIRONMENT.md` |
| Workflow or process change | `docs/WORKFLOWS.md` or `docs/RUNBOOK.md` |
| Release or deployment | `docs/RELEASES.md` |
| Security change | `docs/SECURITY.md` |
| API change | `docs/API.md` |
| Supabase schema or vault change | `docs/SUPABASE.md` |
| Task assigned or reassigned | `docs/TASKS.md` — preserve `[@handle]` assignee format |

## Active Collaborators
| Handle | Name | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `@eric` | Eric Jaffe | Lead / Architect |
| `@david` | David | Collaborator |

## Code Conventions
- **Server Components by default** — only add `'use client'` when interactivity or browser APIs are required
- **Supabase server client** (`src/lib/supabase/server.ts`) in Server Components and Route Handlers
- **Supabase browser client** (`src/lib/supabase/client.ts`) in Client Components only
- **OpenAI client** — use lazy-init via `getOpenAI()` from `src/lib/openai.ts` (never top-level instantiation, breaks build without env vars)
- **Server Actions** for all data mutations — never raw `fetch()` to internal APIs from components (exception: client-side forms that call API routes directly)
- **Never put secrets** (service role key, OpenAI API key, GitHub token) in `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` env vars
- Route protection via middleware when auth is enabled — `/dashboard/**` requires auth
- **Entities must pre-exist**: Organizations and members must be created before projects. Owner must be a validated member of the selected org.
- Status values are standardized: `not-started | in-progress | complete | blocked | pending | on-hold`
- **Branding**: All client-facing output (PDFs, emails, share pages, proposals) must use `getBranding(orgId?)` from `src/lib/branding.ts` — never hardcode company names, colors, or logos. Platform defaults + per-org overrides are resolved automatically. Co-branding modes: `agency-only | co-branded | client-only | white-label`

## Security Rules
- **Never** put OpenAI API keys, service role keys, or GitHub tokens in `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars
- Supabase service role client used only in API routes and server actions, never exposed to client
- RBAC: org member roles (owner, admin, member, viewer) — enforce at DB layer via RLS
- RLS should be enabled on all PM tables — verify policies before every migration
- Validate entity relationships server-side (org exists, owner is org member) before mutations

## Environment Variables
| Variable | Required | Context |
|---|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Yes | Client + Server |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Yes | Client + Server |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Yes | Server only |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Yes | Server only |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | No | Server only (vault export) |
| `GITHUB_VAULT_REPO` | No | Server only (vault export) |

## Daily Workflow Prompts

### Starting your day
> "Pull latest and get up to speed"

This tells Claude to:
1. `git pull origin main` to get the latest code
2. Read `docs/CONTEXT.md`, `docs/ENVIRONMENT.md`, `docs/TASKS.md`, `docs/RUNBOOK.md`
3. Summarize what's in progress and what's next

### Ending your day
> "End of day — commit, push, and update tasks"

This tells Claude to:
1. Update `docs/TASKS.md` with completed and newly discovered work
2. Commit all changes with clear messages
3. Push to the working branch
4. Give a summary of what was done and what's next

## On Session Start (Claude instructions)
Read these docs automatically before doing any work:
1. `docs/CONTEXT.md` — purpose, architecture, module scope
2. `docs/ENVIRONMENT.md` — env vars and secrets map
3. `docs/TASKS.md` — active tasks, backlog, completed work
4. `docs/RUNBOOK.md` — operational procedures
5. Scan `docs/DECISIONS/` for ADRs relevant to the current task

If the session involves a specific subsystem, also read:
- AI features → `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md`
- Vault / markdown → `src/lib/vault.ts`
- Deployment → `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`
- Supabase schema → `docs/SUPABASE.md` + `supabase/migrations/`
- Security/RBAC → `docs/SECURITY.md`

## On Session End (Claude instructions)
Before ending a session with meaningful changes:
1. Ensure `docs/TASKS.md` reflects completed and newly discovered work
2. Commit all changes with clear messages (include doc updates in same commit)
3. Push to the working branch

---

## Team Coordination Layer
Read these every session after this file:
- AGENTS.md — four operating modes (Preflight, Build, Stuck, Closeout)
- docs/TEAM.md — ownership map and coordination rules
- docs/ACTIVE_WORK.md — live work status across the team
- docs/HANDOFF.md — session closeout notes
- docs/PROMPT_LIBRARY.md — proven patterns for this codebase
- docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md — known failure modes
- docs/PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md — where this product is going
